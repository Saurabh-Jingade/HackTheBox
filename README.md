# Initial page

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```groovy
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

`echo 'You got to be kidding me.'` ðŸ˜„ 

Hi 

Hello

How are you?

This is an update with the previous version.



Adding this line.





There is no page limit here.

We can just go on and on.

## Titles

## aslfkjas;fljaslfjsdlfjsdljsg

### sldkfjldkffjdalsg;kja;slgkjlfkjas;lkfjas;lkj

#### sldfkjslfjsdlgjsdlgjslgjdslgjsdlgjdslgj



## Text Formatting

This is trail for **bold**.

This is trail for _italic_

This is trail for ~~strikethrough~~

~~~~

## Code Blocks

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```bash
echo $PATH
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

```python
print ("Hello World!")
```

`echo $PATH`

`print ("Hello World!")`

```This is a code```

```text

```

\`\`

```javascript
print ("Hello World!")
```

```bash
echo $PATH

```

This is how it's done then.



Got the hang of it.
